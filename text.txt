The Federal Reserve should quickly start to raise its benchmark interest rates next year given “alarmingly high” inflation readings, said Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller on Friday.
The Fed is in the process of winding down its bond purchase program that has supported economic growth during the pandemic. Earlier this week, the Fed decided to end the purchases in March, a few months earlier than had been planned.
“I believe an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate will be warranted shortly after our asset purchases end,” Waller said, in a speech to the Forecasters Club of New York.
Fed watchers have begun debating whether the Fed would raise its benchmark interest rates in March or wait until May. Waller’s comments won’t end that debate, but he appears to be tilting toward an earlier start.
